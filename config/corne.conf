# docs/features/debouncing.md
# by default the debounce algorithm decides that a key is pressed or released after the input is stable for 5 milliseconds, this can be decreased to improve latency or increase it to improve reliability
# if there are problems with a single key press registering multiple inputs, the debounce press and/or release times can be increased to compensate
# global debounce time for key press in milliseconds, default 5
